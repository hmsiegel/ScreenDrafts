# Screen Drafts

Screen Drafts is a podcast where experts and enthusiasts competitively collaborate in the creation of screen-centric "Best Of" lists.

This website application is being written to assist with the game format of the podcast. It will also act as a compendium to the [Screen Drafts Wiki](https://screendrafts.fandom.com/wiki/Screen_Drafts).

It will be written in two parts: the front-end will use [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/), while the back-end API will use [.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/core).
